CRUCIAL:

Extra points for flipping a jack or having a jack that matches the suit of the flip card

Special flush rules (only 5-card counts in the crib, and a 4-card flush only counts if the cards were all hand cards)

Game finishes as soon as someone hits 121 (Use a class to keep track of score, so when set_attr occurs you can check the total)
EXTRA:

Make computer choose cards for crib instead of random selection

Use a single variable to store a list of two lists for the players' hands so we can define a function for deal?

Confirm crib choices
